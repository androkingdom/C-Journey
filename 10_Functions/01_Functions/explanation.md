# Functions in C

## Overview

Functions in C are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. By using functions, we can divide complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks. Functions make code more modular, reusable, and easier to debug.

## Function Prototype

A function prototype is a declaration of a function that tells the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters before its actual definition. This allows the compiler to check for the correct use of the function in the code.

```c
int multi(int, int);
int add(int, int);
```

## Function Definition

A function definition provides the actual body of the function, including the statements that define what the function does.

### `multi` Function

The `multi` function multiplies two integers and prints the result.

```c
int multi(int a, int b){
    printf("Multiply of %d and %d is %d\n", a, b, a * b);
}
```

In this function:
- `int multi(int a, int b)` is the function signature where `multi` is the function name, and it takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`.
- The `printf` statement outputs the result of the multiplication.

### `add` Function

The `add` function adds two integers and returns the sum.

```c
int add(int x, int y){
    return x + y;
}
```

In this function:
- `int add(int x, int y)` is the function signature where `add` is the function name, and it takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`.
- The `return` statement returns the sum of `x` and `y` to the caller.

## Function Call

To use the functions, you need to call them from the `main()` function or any other function. Here's how the function calls are made:

```c
int main(){
    multi(2, 5); // Calling Function "multi"
    int sum_of_1_and_2 = add(1, 2); // Calling Function "add"
    printf("Sum of 1 and 2 is %d", sum_of_1_and_2);
    return 0;
}
```

In this `main()` function:
- `multi(2, 5);` calls the `multi` function with arguments `2` and `5`, which prints the multiplication result.
- `int sum_of_1_and_2 = add(1, 2);` calls the `add` function with arguments `1` and `2`, and stores the result in the variable `sum_of_1_and_2`.
- `printf("Sum of 1 and 2 is %d", sum_of_1_and_2);` prints the sum of `1` and `2`.

## The `return` Statement

The `return` statement is used in a function to exit the function and optionally pass back a value to the calling function. When the `return` statement is executed, control is immediately transferred back to the calling function. The value specified in the `return` statement is the result of the function and can be used by the caller.

In the `add` function:
- The `return x + y;` statement returns the sum of `x` and `y` to the caller. This value can be stored in a variable or used directly in an expression as below:
```c
int sum_of_1_and_2 = add(1, 2);
printf("sum of 1 and 2 is %d", sum_of_1_and_2);
```

## Output

When the program is executed, the output will be:

```
Multiply of 2 and 5 is 10
Sum of 1 and 2 is 3
```

This output is generated by the `printf` statements within the `multi` and `main` functions, showing the multiplication and addition of the respective numbers provided as arguments to the functions.
